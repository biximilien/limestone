    %h1.title Welcome to the coveted Pro Page!
    %p
      You can only see this page if you have the
      %code pro
      role. The only way to get the pro role is if a Stripe webhook (
      %code> customer.subscription.updated
      ) reports that the customer subscription has been updated and has the plan which has the
      %code pro
      associated_role. Neat, right?
